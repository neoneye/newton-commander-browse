# newton-commander-browse

The child process that runs for each open tab within Newton Commander.

When you open a tab in the UI then a browse-worker process is started.

When you close a tab in the UI then a browse-worker process is killed.

If a browse-worker process hangs forever then it doesn't affect the parent process (Newton Commander).
